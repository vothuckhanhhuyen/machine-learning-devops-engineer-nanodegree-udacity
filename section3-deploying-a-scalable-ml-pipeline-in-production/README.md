# Deploying a scalable ML pipeline in production

This course teaches students how to robustly deploy a machine learning model into production. 
- En route to that goal students will learn how to put the finishing touches on a model by taking a fine grained approach to model performance, checking bias, and ultimately writing a model card. 
- Students will also learn how to version control their data and models using Data Version Control (DVC). 
- The last piece in preparation for deployment will be learning Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment which will be accomplished using GitHub Actions and Heroku, respectively. 
- Finally, students will learn how to write a fast, type-checked, and auto-documented API using FastAPI.
