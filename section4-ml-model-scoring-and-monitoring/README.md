# ML model scoring and monitoring

This course will help students automate the devops processes required to score and re-deploy ML models. 
- Students will automate model training and deployment. 
- They will set up regular scoring processes to be performed after model deployment, and also learn to reason carefully about model drift, and whether models need to be retrained and re-deployed. 
- Students will learn to diagnose operational issues with models, including data integrity and stability problems, timing problems, and dependency issues. 
- Finally, students will learn to set up automated reporting with APIâ€™s.
