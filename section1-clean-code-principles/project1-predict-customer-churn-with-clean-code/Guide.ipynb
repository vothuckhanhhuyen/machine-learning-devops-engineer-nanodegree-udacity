These functions have been set up to guide you to a solution (no intended tricks here).

    "These are the three files you will need to complete after refactoring the *churn_notebook.ipynb* file:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***churn_library.py***<br>\n",
    "The *churn_library.py* is a library of functions to find customers who are likely to churn.  You may be able to complete this project by completing each of these functions, but you also have the flexibility to change or add functions to meet the rubric criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    " The document strings have already been created for all the functions in the **churn_library.py** to assist with one potential solution. In addition, for a better understanding of the function call, see the **Sequence diagram** in the classroom. \n",
    " \n",
    " After you have defined all functions in the *churn_library.py*, you may choose to add an `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` block that allows you to run the code below and understand the results for each of the functions and refactored code associated with the original notebook.\n",
    " \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ipython churn_library.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***churn_script_logging_and_tests.py***<br> \n",
    "This file should:  \n",
    " - Contain unit tests for the *churn_library.py* functions. You have to write test for *each* input function. Use the basic assert statements that test functions work properly. The goal of test functions is to checking the returned items aren't empty or folders where results should land have results after the function has been run.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Log any errors and INFO messages. You should log the info messages and errors in a .log file, so it can be viewed post the run of the script. The log messages should easily be understood and traceable.\n",
    "\n",
    " Also, ensure that testing and logging can be completed on the command line, meaning, running the below code in the terminal should test each of the functions and provide any errors to a file stored in the */logs* folder.\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "ipython churn_script_logging_and_tests.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " >**Testing framework**: As long as you fulfil all the rubric criteria, the choice of testing framework rests with the student. For instance, you can use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/getting-started.html#) for writing functional tests.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ***README.md***<br>\n",
    "This file will provide an overview of the project, the instructions to use the code, for example, it explains how to test and log the result of each function. For instance, you can have the following detailed sections in the *README.md* file:\n",

    "  - Files and data description\n",
    "  - Running the files\n",

    "## Code Quality Considerations\n",
    "- **Style Guide** - Format your refactored code using [PEP 8 â€“ Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). Running the command below can assist with formatting. To assist with meeting pep 8 guidelines, use `autopep8` via the command line commands below:\n",
    "\n",

    "autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive churn_script_logging_and_tests.py\n",
    "autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive churn_library.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Style Checking and Error Spotting** - Use [Pylint](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/) for the code analysis looking for programming errors, and scope for further refactoring. You should check the pylint score using the command below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pylint churn_library.py\n",
    "pylint churn_script_logging_and_tests.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " You should make sure you don't have any errors, and that your code is scoring as high as you can get it!  Shoot for a `pylint` score exceeding 7 for both Python files. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Docstring** - All functions and files should have document strings that correctly identifies the inputs, outputs, and purpose of the function. All files have a document string that identifies the purpose of the file, the author, and the date the file was created.\n",
