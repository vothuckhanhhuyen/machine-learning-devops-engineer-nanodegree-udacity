## Key Terms

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): An interactive analysis performed at the beginning of the project, to explore the data and learn as much as possible from it. It informs many decisions about the development of a model. For example, we typically discover what kind of pre-processing the data needs before it can be used for training or for inference. It is also important to verify assumptions that have been made about the data and the problem.

- Feature Engineering: The process of creating new features by combining and/or transforming existing features.

- Feature Store: A MLops tool that can store the definition as well as the implementation of features, and serve them for online (real-time) inference with low latency and for offline (batch) inference with high throughput.
