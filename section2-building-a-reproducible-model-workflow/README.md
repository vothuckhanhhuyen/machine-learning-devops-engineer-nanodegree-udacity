# Building a Reproducible Model Workflow

This course empowers the students to be more efficient, effective, and productive in modern, real-world ML projects by adopting best practices around reproducible workflows. In particular, it teaches the fundamentals of MLops and how to:
- Create a clean, organized, reproducible, end-to-end machine learning pipeline from scratch using MLflow
- Clean and validate the data using pytest 
- Track experiments, code, and results using GitHub and Weights & Biases
- Select the best-performing model for production
- Deploy a model using MLflow. Along the way, it also touches on other technologies like Kubernetes, Kubeflow, and Great Expectations and how they relate to the content of the class.
